I have completed the requested changes.

Here's a summary of what I did:

**In `user-service`:**
*   Added a `userExists` endpoint to `UserController.java` at `/auth/user/{id}/exists`.
*   Added the `existsById` method to the `IUserService` interface and implemented it in `UserServiceImpl`.

**In `attendance-service`:**
*   Updated the `UserServiceFeignClient` to use the correct paths for `getUserById` and `userExists`.

**In `membership-service`:**
*   Added a `userExists` method to the `UserClient` Feign client.
*   Updated the `subscribe` method in `SubscriptionServiceImpl` to use the `userExists` method for better efficiency.

**In `fithub-frontend`:**
*   Added a `subscribeToPlan` function to `api/subscriptions.ts`.
*   Created a new `useSubscriptions` hook to handle the subscription logic.
*   Updated the `PlansPage.tsx` to include a "Subscribe" button for each plan, with loading and error handling.

I have successfully built all the services and the frontend, and the changes are working as expected. If you have any other questions, feel free to ask.
